 * find your own starting point at all. Colour and size were not enough on their own,
 * because every other layer here is also a disc; the shape is what separates it. Styling
 * lives in index.css under `.origin-marker-pin`.
 *
 * A divIcon rather than Leaflet's default marker: that icon resolves its PNGs by relative
 * URL, which Vite does not rewrite, so it renders broken without shipping the images
 * through public/. Inline HTML has no such dependency — LiveTransitMapLayer does the same.
 *
 * `iconAnchor` puts the pin's *tip* on the coordinate, not its centre: a pin that floats
 * with its middle on the point is pointing 20px north of where the user actually is. The
 * value follows from the geometry — the head is a 32px box at left 6, top 2, so its
 * centre is (22, 18), and rotating it 45° puts the tip half a diagonal below that.
 *
 * The class name `origin-marker` is load-bearing for the acceptance checks that assert
 * AC 3.1.4's "the starting point is drawn distinctly"; keep it if this is restyled.
